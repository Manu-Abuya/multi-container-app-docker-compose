# multi-container-app-docker-compose

This project demonstrates the deployment of a multi-container application using Docker Compose. The application consists of separate containers for a web server, a database, and a caching layer, enabling them to run and communicate with each other seamlessly.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Docker: [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Docker Compose: [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Project Structure

The project directory has the following structure:

```
my_project/
├── docker-compose.yml
├── web/
│   └── Dockerfile
├── database/
│   └── Dockerfile
└── cache/
    └── Dockerfile
```

- `docker-compose.yml`: The Docker Compose configuration file defining the services.
- `web/`: Directory containing the Dockerfile and code for the web server.
- `database/`: Directory containing the Dockerfile and any initialization scripts for the database.
- `cache/`: Directory containing the Dockerfile and configuration for the caching layer.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git`
2. Change into the project directory: `cd your-repo`
3. Build and start the containers using Docker Compose: `docker-compose up --build`
4. Access the web server by opening a web browser and visiting `http://localhost:8080`. Replace `localhost` with the appropriate hostname if running Docker on a remote machine.
5. When you are done, stop the containers: `docker-compose down`

## Customization

- To customize the web server, update the `web/Dockerfile` with your preferred base image, dependencies, and startup commands.
- To customize the database, update the `database/Dockerfile` with your preferred base image, dependencies, initialization scripts, and additional configuration.
- To customize the cache service, update the `cache/Dockerfile` with your preferred base image, dependencies, and additional configuration.
